Hello!

For this project, I have recreated a coding project that I did in college, only with a few more requirements to make it a bit more of a challenge for myself. This program is intended to be a flashcard program that will ask you questions related to programming and you will be expected to provide the correct answer, giving certain messages depending on how many you answer correctly in a row.

The reason I remade this project is because at the time, I did not know how to use git or GitHub, so I think it would be beneficial for me to redo this project while using it as a tool so that I can become more familiar with it. The second is that I also want to challenge myself a bit more this time around, and to do that I will be giving this program a GUI, whereas before it was only a CLI program. I have never done this before, and so I taught myself how to use Swing throughout this project.

If you would like to see a quick demonstration of how the program works, you can watch it here (https://youtu.be/4SOtkBhWHns)
