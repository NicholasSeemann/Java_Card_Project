Hello!

This will be my attempt at recreating a coding project I did in college as best I can from memory. This program is intended to be a flashcard program that will ask you questions related to programming and you will be expected to provide the correct answer, giving certain messages depending on how many you answer correctly in a row.

The reason I am remaking this project is because at the time, I did not know how to use git or GitHub, so I think it would be beneficial for me to redo this project while using it as a tool so that I can become more familiar with it. The second is that I also want to challenge myself a bit more this time around, and to do that I will be giving this program a GUI, whereas before it was only a CLI program. I have never done this before, so I will have to teach myself how to do so as I create this project.

This project is now complete! By down
